If developing on Windows, need to install pycocotools via `pip install pycocotools-windows` before proceeding. Otherwise, install pycocotools through the usual route, i.e. `pip3 install cython; pip3 install 'git+https://github.com/cocodataset/cocoapi.git#subdirectory=PythonAPI'`. If errors encountered trying to run this via Windows command prompt, try PowerShell instead.

It is highly recommended to install `pytorch==1.7.0` with compatible `torchaudio` and `torchvision`.

Install all remaining dependencies with `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
